sbomgr is a tool to automate installation of packages from SlackBuilds.org
(SBo) or other git-based SlackBuild repositories. It works by cloning the git 
repository and running the SlackBuild scripts along with installpkg and
removepkg.  It also keeps track of installed SBo packages, lists dependencies
and inverse dependencies, searches and shows information about packages, and 
more. For a list of available options, just type 'sbomgr' or 'sbomgr --help'.

Parameters can be edited in the configuration file /etc/sbomgr/sbomgr.conf.
Use this file to set the Slackware release and other options. Non-SBo
repositories can be managed by using a custom configuration file and pointing
sbomgr to it when running; e.g.:

CONF=/path/to/custom/config/file sbomgr OPTIONS
