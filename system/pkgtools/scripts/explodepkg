Usage: explodepkg package_name [package_name2, ...]

Explodes a Slackware compatible software package
(or any tar+{gzip,bzip2,lzma,xz archive) in the current directory.
Equivalent to (for each package listed):

  ( umask 000 ; cat package_name | COMPRESSOR -dc | tar xvf package_name )

Note: This should only be used for debugging or examining packages, not for 
installing them.  It doesn't execute installation scripts or update the package
indexes in /var/log/packages and /var/log/scripts.
