sboui is an ncurses-based user interface for sbopkg, sbotools, and similar tools
to manage packages built from SlackBuilds.org scripts. It also includes a built-
in package manager if you wish to use it standalone. It has been built from the
ground up using ncurses and C++ to give a very efficient and user-friendly
interface. It features forward and reverse dependency resolution, filters,
searching, tagging, browsing and modifying files in the SBo repo, and storing
build options for packages. Both keyboard and mouse (in development) interaction
are fully supported.

The SlackBuild script supports the following build options:
* USE_NINJA=yes (default no): build with Ninja instead of GNU Make. If yes,
  ninja is required.
* CXX_COMPILER=clang++ or other (default g++): switch C++ compiler.
