sboui is an ncurses-based user interface for sbopkg, sbotools, and similar tools
to manage packages built from SlackBuilds.org scripts. Unlike other Slackware
system administration tools with dialog-based user interfaces, sboui is written
in C++ utilizing low-level ncurses library calls. It features a two-pane listing
of software groups and names, multiple filters, searching, forward and inverse
dependency resolution, tagging multiple packages to apply batch changes,
configurable colors, and more. In addition to supporting the well-known SBo
package managers, it also includes a built-in package manager, and it is easy to
make it work with custom tools.
