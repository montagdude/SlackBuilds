Matplotlib strives to produce publication quality 2D graphics for
interactive graphing, scientific publishing, user interface
development and web application servers targeting multiple user
interfaces and hardcopy output formats.  The 'pylab' mode
of ipython uses matplotlib to emulate matlab graphics.

NOTES: If you want to enable the optional subpackages tests and
       toolkits_tests you need to install nose and mock before
       matplotlib.
       To enable the above mentioned subpackages you have to set
       the variables DISABLE_TESTS and DISABLE_TK_TESTS respectively
       to "no".
       toolkits_tests doesn't get installed, if test and/or toolkits
       are disabled. The installation of toolkits is done automatically.
