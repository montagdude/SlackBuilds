# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.
# Line up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and
# the '|' on the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.
# You must make exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also
# customary to leave one space after the ':' except on otherwise blank lines.

libxfoil: libxfoil (2-D airfoil aerodynamics library)
libxfoil:
libxfoil: libxfoil is a library to analyze the aerodyanmics of 2-dimensional
libxfoil: airfoil sections programmatically using the Xfoil aerodynamics engine.
libxfoil: Given airfoil coordinates, operating points, options, and flap
libxfoil: deflections, it calculates lift, drag, pitching moment coefficients,
libxfoil: and transition locations. It can also generate 4- and 5-digit NACA
libxfoil: sections and is fully parallelized with OpenMP. Fortran90, C, and
libxfoil: Python bindings are provided.
