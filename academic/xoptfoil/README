Xoptfoil is an airfoil optimization code using the Xfoil aerodynamics engine. It
supports up to 30 operating points and many constraints. Optimization objectives
include minimizing drag, maximizing glide slope, minimizing sink rate,
maximizing lift, and maximizing the turbulent transition location. Particle
swarm or genetic algorithms are the main optimization methods. Xoptfoil also
includes a tool to monitor the optimization and plot the results.
