XFOIL is an interactive program for the design and analysis of subsonic isolated
airfoils. It consists of a collection of menu-driven routines which perform
various useful functions, such as viscous (or inviscid) analysis of an existing
airfoil, airfoil design and redesign by interactive modification of surface
speed distributions or geometric parameters, blending of airfoils, writing and 
reading of airfoil coordinates and polar save files, and plotting of geometry,
pressure distributions, and multiple polars.
