# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.
# Line up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and
# the '|' on the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.
# You must make exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also
# customary to leave one space after the ':' except on otherwise blank lines.

xfoil: xfoil (interactive program for design and analysis of airfoils)
xfoil:
xfoil: XFOIL is an interactive program for the design and analysis of 
xfoil: subsonic isolated airfoils. It consists of a collection of menu-driven
xfoil: routines which perform various useful functions, such as viscous (or
xfoil: inviscid) analysis of an existing airfoil, design and redesign by
xfoil: interactive modification of surface speed distributions or geometric
xfoil: parameters, blending airfoils, plotting, saving, and reading geometry
xfoil: and polars.
