# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.
# Line up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and
# the '|' on the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.
# You must make exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also
# customary to leave one space after the ':' except on otherwise blank lines.

loraax: loraax (LOw Reynolds number Aircraft Aerodynamics with Xfoil)
loraax:
loraax: LORAAX is a 3D panel code fully coupled with a 2D integral boundary
loraax: layer method (Xfoil). It can predict nonlinearities in the lift and
loraax: pitching moment curves due to the onset of stall, separation bubbles,
loraax: and laminar-turbulent transition. Subsonic compressibility effects are
loraax: accounted for through the Prandtl-Glauert transformation.
