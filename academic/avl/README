AVL is a program for the aerodynamic and flight-dynamic analysis of rigid
aircraft of arbitrary configuration. It employs an extended vortex lattice model
for the lifting surfaces, together with a slender-body model for fuselages and
nacelles. General nonlinear flight states can be specified. The flight dynamic
analysis combines a full linearization of the aerodynamic model about any flight
state, together with specified mass properties.
