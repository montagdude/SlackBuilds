# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.
# Line up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and
# the '|' on the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.
# You must make exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also
# customary to leave one space after the ':' except on otherwise blank lines.

avl: avl (program for aerodynamic and flight-dynamic analysis of aircraft)
avl:
avl: AVL is a program for the aerodynamic and flight-dynamic analysis of
avl: rigid aircraft of arbitrary configuration. It employs an extended
avl: vortex lattice model for the lifting surfaces, together with a
avl: slender-body model for fuselages and nacelles. General nonlinear 
avl: flight states can be specified. The flight dynamic analysis combines a
avl: full linearization of the aerodynamic model about any flight state,
avl: together with specified mass properties.
