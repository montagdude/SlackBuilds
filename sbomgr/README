sbomgr is a tool to automate installation of packages from SlackBuilds.org
(SBo). It works by cloning the SBo git repository and running the SlackBuild
scripts along with installpkg and removepkg.  It also keeps track of installed
SBo packages, lists dependencies and inverse dependencies, searches and shows 
information about packages, and more. For a list of available options, just type
'sbomgr' or 'sbomgr --help'.

Parameters can be edited in the configuration file /etc/sbomgr/sbomgr.conf.
Use this file to set the Slackware release and other options.
