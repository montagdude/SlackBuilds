Republic Anywhere is an integrated technology platform that syncs your phone
number to all your devices.

Note: during startup, it looks for /var/lib/dbus/machine-id' (note trailing
single quote). I'm not sure if that is an error, but after copying
/var/lib/dbus/machine-id to /var/lib/dbus/machine-id', it worked.
