From https://github.com/mkottman/acpi_call:

"A simple kernel module that enables you to call ACPI methods by writing the
method name followed by arguments to /proc/acpi/call."

It is used, for example, by TLP to set custom battery charging thresholds
for some newer Thinkpad models. This module is considered to be a
proof-of-concept and should be used with caution.

To build the package for a kernel different from the running one, start the
script setting the KERNEL variable as in
        KERNEL=4.4.10 ./acpi_call.SlackBuild
