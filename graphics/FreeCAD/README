FreeCAD is a general purpose 3D CAD modeler, aimed at mechanical
engineering and product design, but also fits in a wider range of uses
around engineering, such as architecture or other engineering specialties.

This version is a repackage of the official AppImage from the developers, rather
than a build from source. A .desktop file and icon are included and installed
system-wide, so upon first run it is recommended to tell it not to install them
for the user.
