CRRCSim is a model airplane flight simulation program for Linux with ports to
other platforms. Using CRRCSim you can learn how to fly model aircraft, test
new aircraft designs, and improve your skills by practicing in the relative
safety of your PC. CRRCSim specializes in thermal and slope soaring simulation,
though powered models are also included.
