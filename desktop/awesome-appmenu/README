awesome-appmenu is a tool to create a menu of installed applications for the
awesome window manager. It searches for and parses .desktop files to create
a lua script containing the menu, which can then be used in your awesome WM
configuration script. It supports icons, and the paths to search for launchers
and icons, as well as the categories used for grouping applications, are
fully configurable.
