The Lumina Desktop Environment (Lumina for short) is a lightweight, 
XDG-compliant, BSD-licensed desktop environment that focuses specifically 
on streamlining the ability to get work done while minimizing system 
overhead.

It is specifically designed for PC-BSDÂ® and FreeBSD, but has also been 
ported to many other BSD and Linux operating systems. It is based on the 
Qt graphical toolkit and the Fluxbox window manager, and uses a small 
number of X utilities for various tasks, such as numlockx and xscreensaver. 

"acpi" is an optional dependency for the battery monitor.
