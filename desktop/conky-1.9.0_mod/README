Conky is a system monitor for X originally based on the torsmo code.
Since its original conception, Conky has changed a fair bit from its
predecessor. Conky can display just about anything, either on your
root desktop or in its own window. Conky has many built-in objects, as
well as the ability to execute programs and scripts, then display the
output from stdout. This is a modified version of conky-1.9.0 with 
support for displaying laptop battery power in watts.
